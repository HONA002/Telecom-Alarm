Each telecom site is facing alarm throughout the day. There are many types of alarms which each is demonstrated in one or more RAN KPIs. These effects have been undefined hitherto, so this study has been commenced in order to indicate the influence of each alarm, as well as serving as a train data set to a machine learning algorithm. In this study, Alarms have been occuring in any time. In order to indicate the influence, the period between 2 hours before and 2 hours after of alarm occurance is considered as CURRENT period, as well as period from 2 hours after alarm occurance to 10 hours after alarm occurance, and period containing 2 hours before alarm incidence to 10 hours before alarm occurance are regarded as POST and PRE periods, respectively. By comparing these three periods for each RAN KPI, the effect of alarm can be determined.
